<h1>TERRY KARIUKI</h1>
<h4> EDUCATION</h4>

<P> When speaking of the topic of who a person is and their past, a massive part of this includes their educational background. Isn’t this what forms people, their education? Of course, this doesn’t always have to refer to their organized education. Everything that a person learns is something that educates them; these words being synonymous. Even something like first learning to tie your shoes is a part of your education. Which method works better for you: loop, swoop, and pull, or bunny ears? I of course, like any other well educated person, use loop, swoop, and pull; it’s just the best way, no bias has ever developed there.

    I started out as a twinkle in my father’s eye in the fall of 2000, and then on that fateful day of May 11, 2001 I was born in the big city of Nairobi. Coming into a world of beauty and ruggedness, I soon learned how to interact with the things around me. Never being a small person, smash and grab always seemed to be a good theory for whatever activity I pursued. Even though I may have got a few small scrapes and such along the way, I never did lose my speed and intensity. This is still how I do it - fast and efficiently - always quick to get bored. Coming from the city, you learn a lot about self-reliance and prioritization.
    
    It started out with parents that were always interested in education, mine and their own, whenever I learned something new; they were always interested in it also. I was taught from the beginning much about the things around me, outdoors and in. I was enrolled in Rockfields Junior School where I completed my eight years of primary education. </P>

<p>The teachers taught me well, while my peers taught me more about life. I made my best friends in primary school and we are a family now. I cherished the time I spent in primary school. I was a top student who was doing well, had many friends, and was making a name for myself in sports and extracurricular activities. Then once again graduation rolled around and I had to leave all of the good things behind. But I was ready to embark on an education that was more geared towards my future. High school was an easy transaction. I was enrolled in PIoneer Girls School. I felt like I had the education and maturity level of a young adult. I knew I could handle all of the work and stress that was going to be dealt out in my classes. I noticed that high school was a lot like middle school and that I could handle the schedule. I finally graduated in 2019 attaining my Kenya Certificate of Secondary Eduaction. </p>

<h4> Hobbies</h4>
<p> I remember when I was younger it never cross my mind to be a photographer, I always had this crazy idea about being a Mafia leader, cause they seem interesting to me. Then I started to lean towards a more positive goal in life Along the way I kept changing my mind about what I wanted to be Since photography is my new hobby, it has affected my life, therefore it became my new passion, and my family got involved, and helped me plan my future.
    First, during my senior year in high school, my family noticed that I enjoyed taking pictures so they started to get involved. Usually when I sign up for something like a sport or class, my family would support me with whatever decision I made. Being in a photography class was good because every Friday I would check out a camera and use for the weekend. The more I did that, the more my parents noticed my passion for photography. </p>

     When I take pictures, it’s like seeing things in a new perspective literally and figuratively. you can go up to a flower and see the texture of the petal or put a caterpillar on your finger and see the little hairlike things on it’s body. Thing about the camera and the lens is that it lets you see people, places, etc. in a whole new perspective and it helps to see things from a different view. From photography, I realized that getting a different view of things means you have a more open mind to the world. Which is why it’s always been my favorite hobby.
